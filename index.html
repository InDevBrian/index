<a href="./_e28_downloads/TPS_ADAPTER.zip">M50 throttle position sensor for M20 throttle body</a> <!--organize _e28_downloads into the media folder maybe? just do a properly organized file system before this place gets crowded-->
<p>
    ^ that shit probably works on other throttle bodies, maybe it needs slight adjustments
    </br>
    Solidworks model, STL, drawings, just download and print it. (drawings aren't actually in there yet because I havent done them yet)
</p>

<a href="./_e28_downloads/CAM_TRIGGER_SETUP.zip">M20 Camshaft Trigger Wheel + acc</a>
<p>
    A trigger wheel to go in place of the m20 dizzy.
    </br>
    Use it for sequential ignition/injection, or dont. fuck me yea
    </br>
    Meant to support an M50 cam position sensor, probably doesnt yet i havent tested much.

<a href="./Media/Tow_Hitch_Receiver_Report.pdf">the report for the development</a>
<p>
    A tow hitch receiver for NA e28 chassis.
    </br>
    I did math for it, check it out. tell me if it's wrong

    I think it's pretty cool but will get better when I revisit this project.
